#ExpenseSync: Hackathon Submission
Project for: Odoo
Challenge: Advanced Expense Management System
Submitted By: Code Crew

Hello Review Team,

Welcome to the repository for ExpenseSync, our submission for the Odoo hackathon. This project is a functional prototype designed as a comprehensive solution to the expense management challenge provided.

Our goal was to build a clean, intuitive, and interactive user interface that demonstrates the core functionalities and user flows for a multi-role expense approval system.

The Challenge: Problem Statement
The hackathon challenge was to design a system to replace time-consuming, error-prone, and non-transparent manual expense reimbursement processes. The key requirements were to build a platform that could handle:

Multi-level approval workflows.

Flexible and conditional approval rules.

Distinct roles and permissions for Employees, Managers, and Administrators.

Our Solution & Approach
To address this, we developed a high-fidelity, interactive prototype. Our approach was to create a complete application experience using client-side JavaScript and localStorage to manage application state and simulate data persistence. This enabled us to focus on creating a seamless and user-friendly experience for all three required roles within the hackathon timeframe.

âœ… Key Features Implemented
We successfully implemented the following features based on the problem statement:

User Roles & Authentication:

Role-based access with distinct dashboards for Admins, Managers, and Employees.

Functional Signup, Login, and Password Reset UI.

Simulated user persistence using browser localStorage.

Employee Dashboard (employee.html):

At-a-glance summary of expense statuses (Draft, Pending, Approved).

Intuitive modal for creating and submitting new expenses.

Ability to save multiple expenses as drafts and submit them in a single batch.

Manager Dashboard (manager.html):

A dedicated approval queue showing all pending expenses from the team.

A detailed view for each expense, providing all necessary context for a decision.

Functional "Approve" and "Reject" actions that update the expense status in the UI.

Admin Dashboard (admin.html):

A high-level overview of system-wide metrics.

A User Management interface to simulate adding, editing, and assigning roles.

A mock interface for configuring Approval Rules.

ðŸš€ How to Test Our Submission
Our prototype can be run directly in any modern web browser. No installation is required.

1. Get the Code:

Bash

# Clone this repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ExpenseSync.git

# Navigate into the project folder
cd ExpenseSync
2. Recommended Testing Flow:

We suggest following these steps to experience the full, intended user journey:

Start the Application: Open index.html. Use the "Sign up" link to create a new user account.

Submit an Expense: After signing up, you will be on the employee dashboard (employee.html). Use the "+ New Expense" button to create a claim. Save it, and notice it appears in the table as a "Draft".

Submit for Approval: Click the "Submit All Drafts" button. The expense status will change to "Pending".

Become a Manager: Now, open manager.html in your browser. You will see the expense you just submitted in the "Approvals to Review" table.

Approve/Reject: Click the expense in the list to see its details on the right. Use the "Approve" or "Reject" buttons to take action. The UI will update to reflect your decision.

Become an Admin: Finally, open admin.html to see the global dashboard, including the user management panel and recent company-wide expenses.
